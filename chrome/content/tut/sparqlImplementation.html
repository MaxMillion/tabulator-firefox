<h1>SPARQL Features Implemented in Tabulator SPARQL View</h1>

<p>This document specifies which features of SPARQL are implemented in Tabulator's SPARQL view. Note 
that Tabulator <b>does not</b> fully support the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL specification</a>. All 
references in parenthesis are to section numbers within this <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">specification</a>. </p>

<h3>Implemented Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>All the features for "Writing a Simple Query" (2.1) are implemented, with the exception of the BASE keyword. 
Prefixed URIs, abbreviated triples, [] and prefixed bnodes are supported.</li>
<li>RDF literals <i>may</i> be used as the subject of triples (2.3). This is not yet supported in RDF, but may be in the future.</li>
<li>Predicate-Object lists (2.8.1) and Object lists (2.8.2) are implemented.</li>
<li>Blank nodes in SPARQL queries act as existential, undisplayed variables (2.8.3).</li>
<li>The keyword 'a' can be substituted for rdf:type (2.8.5)</li>
<li>Literal support with languages and datatypes (3). Convenience syntax for xsd:**** is not supported</li>
<li>Value constraints (FILTERs) are implemented to a limited extent:
<ul>
	<li>All filters can only involve a direct boolean function on one variable. Therefore, functions on multiple 
	variables such as geographic distance cannot yet be implemented. Also, filters can only be used in a very specified 
	way as outlined below. Finally, there can be only one filter per variable.</li>
	<li>Filters of the form [variable] ['='||'<'||'>'] [URI||literal] are acceptable.</li>
	<li>Filters of the form 'REGEXP (' [variable] ',' '"'[Javascript Regular Expression]'"' ')' are acceptable. Tags are not implemented.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group graph patterns (4.1) are acceptable; however, you cannot group triples into graph sub-patterns with {}. I'm not sure what the 
functionality of this would be if it was allowed, or how it would differe from the absence of such {}.</li>
<li>Unbound variables (4.3) are allowed in query results. They return with the value "." in the table view.</li>
<li>All syntax with the "OPTIONAL" keyword is accepted, including multiple nested OPTIONALs, and FILTERs within OPTIONALs. 
However, it is very difficult to "smush" the results of different optionals at the same level of nesting (e.g. <i>pattern</i> 
OPTIONAL { <i>pattern</i> } OPTIONAL { <i>pattern</i> }). Therefore, in the case of multiple optionals, they are not "smushed": for each 
graph-match to either optional subgraph, a result is displayed. This is open to suggestions for improvement.</li>

<li>

</ul>

<h3>Not Implemented</h3>
<ul>
<li>The BASE keyword (2.1.1) is not implemented</li>
<li>The () short form for rdf:collection (2.8.4) is not implemented. rdf:first and rdf:rest can still be used.</li>
<li>Most of the filter evaluation (11) is not yet implemented (except for those mentioned above).</li>
<li>Comments with '#' do not work.</li>
<li>The UNION keyword (6.1) is not implemented.</li>
<li>Accessing and specifying named graphs (8,9) is not relevant to the tabulator store, and in particular, the GRAPH keyword is not implemented</li>
<li>The alternative query result forms CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE, and ASK (10) are not relevant to the tabulator, and not implemented</li>
<li>The SELECT * form is not supported</li>
<li>The ORDER BY, DISTINCT, LIMIT, and OFFSET keywords (10.1.1-10.1.5) are not implemented.</li>
<li>Results of a query cannot be returned as XML in the SPARQL standard.</li>


</ul>

<h3>Other important information about SPARQL view implementation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unlike a normal SPARQL endpoint, that has all relevant data in an internal triple-store, tabulator uses a dynamic store constructed by 
accessing external rdf resources, or 'links', based on RDF URIs. Therefore, a query will act on the current triples in tabulator's store, while 
also fetching resources that are subjects or objects (and their ontologies/seeAlso's) of the SPARQL query or of partial graph matches at query-time. 
Thus, if triples about a URI exist somewhere other than at the resource specified by the URI, the returned results may be dependent on which resources have 
been added to the triple-store (e.g. in the outliner).</li>
