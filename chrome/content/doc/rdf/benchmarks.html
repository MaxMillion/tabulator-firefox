width="640" height="480"> A head-to-head comparison of Jim Ley's
JavaScript RDF/XML Parser and RDFParser. If this image does not display
for you, you can view the <a
href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2005/ajar/ajaw/test/rdf/rdfparser.perf.svg">SVG
document</a> or a <a

version</a>.</object></div>

<p>A <a
href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2005/ajar/ajaw/test/rdf/rdfparser.perf.png">raster
version</a> of this image is available for those without SVG display
capabilities. As an aside, users of SVG renderers supporting the
&lt;script&gt; tag should note that the bars, on mouse over, highlight,
error bars appear and data values are displayed. Additionally, the
resource names in blue at the bottom of the graph are linked to the
tabulator's interface for browsing. If your SVG renderer is not
&lt;script&gt; capable, you should see the bar graph with all error bars
and data values.</p>

<p>The files used to bench the parsers were arbitrarily chosen as 'real
world' examples.</p>

<p>Each file was parsed 25 times to achieve a relatively small standard
error. The benchmarking was done in <em>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686;
en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060608 Ubuntu/dapper-security
Firefox/1.5.0.4</em> on a cleanly booted, idle IBM Thinkpad R52 laptop
with 512MB of memory and a 1.83GHz processor. The DOM was cloned for
each run and each parser was run on its own to avoid interaction with
the other.</p>

<p>As you can see, the new parser performs comparably but worse on four
of the five 'real world' test cases. This is somewhat misleading,
however, because the parser's speed is highly dependent on the
serialization of the RDF into XML. If we construct test cases with
compact RDF/XML serialization, we find that the old parser is no contest
for RDFParser. With these test cases, however, the old parser also does
not return all the serialized triples as it does not support the compact
serialization shortcuts in the RDF/XML specification. For example, <a
href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2005/ajar/ajaw/test/rdf/compact.rdf">this
file</a> parses at <strong>1.33 +/- 0.03 ms/triple in RDFParser</strong>
but only <strong>1.88 +/- 0.04 ms/triple in the old
parser</strong>. <em>The old parser also does not return all the
triples.</em> The file contains 18 triples but the old parser returns
only 15 (the speed per triple was calculating as if both parsers had
returned 18 triples).</p>
